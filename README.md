# Simple Python Games

Here are some of the somewhat simple but famous games that I have coded with Python on my free time. 

So far I only have Battleship and Hangman, but I am looking to code more and share them here when I get time.

I learned Python on Codecademy and got help starting up Battleship from one of its lesson. I made numerous adjustments and added some user-friendly features on it such as marking the location of the Battleship if the user loses. Hangman on the other hand was a game I coded completely from scratch with the knowledge I learned from Codecademy. The code is not as clean as Battleship but it does everything it needs to do. I would definitely like to improve my Python knowledge so I can make everything I code from now cleaner. 

I didn't attach any pictures of the finished product as I have all the code in here, just copy/paste them into your Python IDE and outputing them would probably be better than me posting some picture examples.
